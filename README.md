This repository is a re-implemented PyTorch version based on https://github.com/PeiqinSun/tf-tutorials/tree/master/01-svhn. 

The '.diff' file is generated by the command 'diff -u baseline.py xxx.py >> xxx.diff'.

### 
model.py is the re-implemented PyTorch model with the same structure.

baseline.py is the code for the basic svhn classification tasks.
